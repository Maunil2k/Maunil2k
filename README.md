### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Maunil, an undergraduate student in mechanical engineering from VJTI, Mumbai.<br />
Although I come from a core background, my interest lies majorly in Robotics and Deep Learning.<br />
I have worked on various kaggle competitions and out of CV, NLP, speech and time-series, I'm more inclined towards CV.<br /><br />
Here's what you need to know about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working/trying to implement vision transformer research paper (An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale) using tensorflow. If that goes well, I'll be moving on to implement the segformer paper. If you're willing to collaborate with me for the same, feel free to reach me out.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linear Algebra and revisiting the concepts of ML.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting research opportunities specifically involving image-based (CV) deeplearning problems. I'm also open for pre-doc research position in the same domain.
