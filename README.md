### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Maunil, an undergraduate student in mechanical engineering from VJTI, Mumbai.<br />
Although I come from a core background my interest lies majorly in Robotics and Deep Learning.<br />
I have worked on various kaggle competitions and out of CV, NLP, speech, time-series and GANs, I'm more inclined towards CV.<br /><br />
Here's what you need to know about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a kaggle competition involving segmentation of Functional Tissue Units(FTUs) involving 5 human organs. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linear Algebra and revisiting the concepts of ML.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting research opportunities specifically involving image-based (CV) deeplearning problems.
